# nlp_calculator_app

My First proper Flutter project. It is an AI NLP Calculator, that turns what you say, into an equation, then proceeds to solve it for you.

## Using the Application

This application has been designed to be completely portable, meaning that you can simply download it by going to - build\windows\x64\runner\Release, and downloading the entire folder. Alternatively, you can go to the releases page on Github, which will display the folder you need to download.

From then on, you can simply utilize the application, which has a specially designed prompt, made to help you type in any maths question in natural language, and the application will turn it into an equation and solve it for you.
